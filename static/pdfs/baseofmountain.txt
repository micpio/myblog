I live at the base of a mountain. It is small mountain compared to the other
mountains that surround, divided by a river it is truly a beautiful place. I
hike often usually along the base and only to the very edge as my stamina is
not what it used to be. There is a wonderful place on the second plateau where
there is a spring, it is clearly marked by a sign I have seen often, simply "Spring".
This land is enchanted in many special ways.The people who live here , the light
that plays off the ranges and mountains and the sounds of life all around me.There
 are two trails along side the river. From the edge of my mountain its simply
 several steps to the first trail that connects the two bridges spanning the river.
Te second trail on the opposite bank requires the use of either bridge and is much longer.
If you traverse it to the south, approximately four miles you will come to a minor falls 
and a small community.
